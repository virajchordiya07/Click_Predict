# Click_Predict: Predictive Model for Ad Clicks Using Fake Advertising Data Project
The provided code performs a binary classification task using a Logistic Regression model to predict whether or not the internet users will click on an ad based off the features.
* Initial exploratory data analysis is performed using Seaborn's plotting functions to visualize the distribution of the 'Age' column, create joint plots for relationships between features, and a pair plot with hue set to 'Clicked on Ad' for an initial overview.
* Then a Logistic Regression model is chosen for binary classification.
* The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set (x_test), and the predictions are stored in the variable p.
### Summary:
* The model achieves an accuracy of 91%, indicating that it performs well in predicting whether a user clicked on an ad or not based on the provided features.
